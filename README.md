# stock-analysis
## Overview of Projects
  This project is supposed to help us bolster our understanding of VBA, working with macros and 
  specifc commands and algorithims that will help analyze the stocks, the total volume for each 
  different stock, and the return of the stock. Moreover, using VBA will help understand big data
  through a series of commands, which is alot more efficient than doing it manually.
  
 ## Results
  According to the results of the stocks, in 2017 there was a higher rate of return for all stocks, 
  except for TERP, and generally the volume of each stock was higher than in 2018, where almost 
  all the stocks in 2018 sees a negative rate in return, except for the stocks ENPH which yield a return of 
  81.9% and RUN which has a return rate of 84%. The runtimes of the refractored code is slightly faster than the 
  Allstock analysis as seen when the the original code usually goes over .5 milliseconds, while the refractored code
  performance is generally slightly below .5 milliseconds

  ## Summary
  ### Advantage and Disadvantage of Refractoring
  The advangate of refractoring code is that editing or altering the code structure while keeping the functionality
  will help you understand the code better and make you better at programming. In addition, refractoring code has the 
  potential to improve the runtime complexity, or the memory space used, as sometimes people want you to create programs
  that take less space and time to run. The disadvantage of refractoring code however, is that it can be time consuming as 
  you need to spend some time figuring out how to later the code without changing its purpose, which can take along tame and be
  very difficult. Also, you may be stuck refractoring and trying to refractor has the potential to ruin or destroy the code
  ### How do these pros and cons apply to refractoring the code in vba
  These pros and cons apply to the refractorization of the original script in VBA, because by taking the time trying to edit
  the code, there is a possibility to create a different version that will help make the code run faster and more efficient.
  However, there were times where I felt like refractoring the code may be time consuming, and without the instructions I may be 
  more stuck trying to refractor the code.
