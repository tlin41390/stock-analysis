# stock-analysis
## Overview of Projects
  This project is supposed to help us bolster our understanding of VBA, working with macros and 
  specifc commands and algorithims that will help analyze the stocks, the total volume for each 
  different stock, and the return of the stock. Moreover, using VBA will help understand big data
  through a series of commands, which is alot more efficient than doing it manually.
  
 ## Results
  According to the results of the stocks, in 2017 there was a higher rate of return for all stocks, 
  except for TERP, and generally the volume of each stock was higher than in 2018, where almost 
  all the stocks in 2018 sees a negative rate in return, except for the stocks ENPH which yield a return of 
  81.9% and RUN which has a return rate of 84%. The runtimes of the refractored code is slightly faster than the 
  Allstock analysis as seen when the the original code usually goes over .5 milliseconds, while the refractored code
  performance is generally slightly below .5 milliseconds
